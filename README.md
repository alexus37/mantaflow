# Mantaflow #

Mantaflow is an open-source framework targeted at fluid simulation research in
Computer Graphics.  Its parallelized C++ solver core, python scene definition
interface and plugin system allow for quickly prototyping and testing new
algorithms.  For more information on how to install, run and code with
Mantaflow, please head over to our home page at
[http://mantaflow.com](http://mantaflow.com)

Please note - we're moving the mantaflow repository to github. In the future,
please use [https://github.com/tum-pbs/mantaflow](https://github.com/tum-pbs/mantaflow).

In addition, it provides a toolbox of for deep learning experiments with
fluids. For a tighter integration with deep learning, please check out our
differentiable solving framework _phiflow_:
